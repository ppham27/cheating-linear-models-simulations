# Cheating Linear Models Simulations

In here is the code for my master's thesis. It consists of 
various statistical simulations related to linear models. 
[Boost](http://www.boost.org/) is used to for the statistical distributions. 
[Armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net/) is used for the linear algebra.
